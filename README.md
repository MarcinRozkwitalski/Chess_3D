# Chess_3D
## Hot-seat chess board game with resizable board.
For this project, I independently developed the chess game's rules and gameplay mechanics from scratch, without external tutorials or references. 

I utilized Raycast to visualize available moves for the currently selected chess piece, implementing highlighted move paths and identifying potential captures of opponent's pawns and pieces. 

Additionally, I managed the initial animation of the chessboard layout and piece movement using the Lerp function.

It's worth noting that the 3D models used in the project were sourced from publicly available assets. 

Looking ahead, my future plans for this project include the implementation of multiplayer functionality.
